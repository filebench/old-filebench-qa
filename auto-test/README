##### FILES #####
root
1.job_template.txt
	describes what to do on ESX and VMs.
	* see HOW TO USE section.
	fbfile - name of filebench archive.
	fbworkload - list of workloads to test.
	vms - list of virtual machines to test on.
2. runesxdaemon.sh
	executes ESXi server side daemon script. The daemon will
	keep running on the ESXi server.
3. stopesxdaemon.sh
	stop ESXi server side daemon script started by runesxdaemon.sh.

esx_scripts - runs on ESXi server
1. rundaemon.sh
	find job.txt description file every 5 seconds
	and if it if found, execute dojob.sh
	this script should always run on ESXi server.
2. dojob.sh
	read job.txt and execute each virtual machines.
	This script can be updated without restarting ESXi
	server side.

vm_scripts - runs on each virtual machine
1. $HOSTNAME$.sh
	main script for each virtual machine. 
2. linux.sh
	Common main scripts for Linux-based OSes(Centos, Ubuntu).
	Although each virtual machine executes its own script,
	Linux-based OSes use same commands. $HOSTNAME$.sh for
	Linux-based OSes are symbolic links to this script.
3. freebsd.sh
	Common main scripts for FreeBSD-based OSes.
4. opensolaris.sh
	Common main scripts for OpenSolaris-based OSes.
5. fbmonitor.sh
	This script runs with filebench at the same time and detect
	any failure or hanging.
6. fbauto.sh
	This script should be copied on each virtual machine and
	executed on boot(rc.local). ESXi does not support 'ssh'
	command, each OS uses boot-up script to perform the test.

results-$DATE$ - stdout and summary files
1. esx.out
	stdout of ESX server.
2. $HOSTNAME$.out
	stdout and stderr of each VM.
3. $HOSTNAME$.summary
	summary of each VM's work.
	This file will be emailed to the tester (Not yet implemented).


##### HOW TO USE #####
* root directory of auto-test is /home/gyumin/esx_job

1. Copy filebench-xxx.tar.gz to root directory

2. Modify job_template.txt

3. cp or mv job_template to job.txt
	Once job.txt exists in root directory, ESX start to run
	auto-test with the job.txt file. During the test, ESX changes
	job.txt to job_processing.txt and when the test is done, ESX
	changes job_processing.txt to job_done.txt

4. When job_done.txt is found, look at the root/results directory.
